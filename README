IdleStarter
===========

For Windows. Have your computer start up a program if it has been idle for a
while. Perhaps start up a node for your render farm.

IdleStarter [-help] [-run "<command>"] [-wait <minutes>] [-cpu <percent>]
            [-memory <percent>]
where:
	-help = Shows usage
	-run "<command>" = Command to run
	-wait <minutes> = Waits minutes before starting (default 1)
	-cpu <percent> = Run only if cpu utilization is less than this (default is 100)
    -memory <percent>  = Run only if memory utilization is less than this
            (default is 100)

====================
Implementation notes
====================
This program hooks into the windows keyboard and mouse to determine if the
computer has been idle. A timer periodically checks for the idleness.

Once the program that is supposed to be started gets started, IdleStarter
will monitor to ensure that it is still running.

There is also a check for CPU and memory level conditions that must be met
before the program is started.

My bro-in-law Paul Covello needed this for something at the office. Thus
IdleStarter was born.
